# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

 This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The Ford Go Bike Data can be downloaded from here: https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found some quality and tidiness issues. There were some missing values, wrong data type and some columns needed for exploration were not present in the dataset. I cleaned the quality and tidiness and start exploration. The main features include data related to the start and end of a ride. This can be used to calculate when bikes are in high or low demand. There is also ample data related to the users of the bike service including their age, gender, and whether they are a paying member or a casual user. There were more subscribers than customers and more males than females. I also found out that the system is being used mostly in the morning hours (8-9am) and afternoon hours (5-6pm). I performed countplot to show the distribution between start hour and user type, which subscribers use the system more than customers. That makes sense because subscribers are mostly working class people using the system to commute to work while customers are mostly tourists that uses the system ton tour the Bay Area.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus more on the usage of the users and their ages. I start with the distribution of usage by hour, followed by usage distribution between user type, age distribution and user age distribution between user type.
